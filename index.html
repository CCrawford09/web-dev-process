                <p>I'm an aspiring computer programmer. I recently graduated from David W Carter High School and turned 19 earlier this year. I am a freshman and have multiple goals I hope to accomplish in the future. One day, I want to create and code my own computers, phones, video games, and many other types of technology. I remember watching a show called Ready Jet Go! It was a scientific kid show and one particular episode talked about 1's and 0's. It captivated me and lead to my interest in computer languages and programming. I want to use the skills gained from this class to help potentially improve humanity.</p>
